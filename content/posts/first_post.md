## This is my first blog post!

I've started this website to document my journey of learning new things. The main goal of this blog is to actively teach the concepts to myself, which forces me to find and fill the gaps in my understanding. If others can benefit from my process, that's an amazing bonus!


In blog post I will often try to implement The Feynman Learning Technique by [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman).
